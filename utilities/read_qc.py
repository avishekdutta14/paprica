Call as:
python read_qc.py -in [fastq or fastq.gz] -phred [desired mean phred score] -n [fraction of bases that may be 'n']

Starting with the lowest scoring bases script will convert these to 'n'
characters with a NaN score until the desired mean phred score is reached.  The
resulting sequences are written to either fasta or fasta.gz, depending on the
format of the input file.

The -n flag indicates the fraction of bases that are allowed to be 'n'.  If this
fraction is exceeded the read will not be kept.  Must be in the range of 0-1.
