CALL AS:
    python extract_pplacer_seqs.py [something.csv] [something.fasta] [start-inclusive] [stop-not inclusive]
    
This script makes a fasta file of the reads associated with a given range of edges.  If you
would like the reads associated within only one edge (such as 1234), you would use edge edge+1
as the arguments (1234 1235).

The input csv file should be the csv file produced by guppy (called in that paprica_place_it script).
It probably has a name that follows the form yoursample.combined_16S.tax.clean.align.csv.

The input fasta should be any fasta file that contains the cleaned reads names.
yoursample.combined_16S.tax.clean.fasta is a good bet.
