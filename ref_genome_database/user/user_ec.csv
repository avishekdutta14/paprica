##	This file can be used to indicate enzymes by EC number that you
##	believe should be in a genome, but do not appear in the genome.
##	These EC numbers will propagate to internal nodes, but will not
##	be used in pathway prediction.  The first row of this file is a
##	header and should not be modified.  Rows should be numbered
##	sequentially.
##
##	Example rows:
##	1,GCF12345,1.1.1.1,happy enzyme
##	2,GCF54321,2.3.4.5,sad enzyme
