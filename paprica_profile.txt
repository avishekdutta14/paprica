#### Please make sure that the pathways end with /.  Complete pathways are recommended for
#### all users and are necessary (due to RAxML requirements) for paprica_build.sh users.
#### Complete pathways follow the form /home/user/genome_finder/ and there should be no
#### space before or after the equal sign.
####
#### The default pathways are not in this form to facilitate a quick start for the
#### impatient (such as myself), but if you are reading this please change to full paths
#### to insure full functionality.
